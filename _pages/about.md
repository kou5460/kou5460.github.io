Hello, visitor! Welcome to my website. I am Koshiro Yamaguchi, and I am working towards my Ph.D. at the University of Washington, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Prior to the UW, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Aerospace Engineering from Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan in March 2018.
At the Unviersity of Washington, I am a member of [the Laboratory for Engineered Materials and Structures](https://faculty.washington.edu/jkyang/index.html), advised by [Dr. Jinkyu Yang](https://www.aa.washington.edu/facultyfinder/jinkyu-jk-yang). 
My research interests lie in the field of origami engineering, advanced materials (composites and metamaterials), nonlinear dynamics, design optimization methods and computational fabrication.
